    <h1>R&D QUESTIONS</h1>

    <div>

        <p>Before the first push, there is no link between the local and remote repository. After the first push, there is a link established between the local and remote repository.</p>
    </div>

    <div>
        <h3>3. How are the &lt;title&gt; tag and &lt;h1&gt; tag fetched when rendering an HTML file with no structure?</h3>
        <p>The browser automatically places the &lt;title&gt; tag into the head and the &lt;h1&gt; tag into the body based on HTML parsing rules and defaults.</p>
    </div>

    <div>
        <h3>4. What is the difference between href and src, and why are they used in img and anchor tags?</h3>
        <p>href is used with the anchor tag to redirect to an external link, while src is used with img tags to embed content within a webpage.</p>
    </div>

        <h3>5. Why are there three dots in if...else and do...while?</h3>
        <p>The three dots (...) in if...else and do...while in documentation or examples are placeholders used to indicate omitted code or logic. They imply additional statements or blocks should be added in those places.</p>
    </div>

    <div>
        <h3>6. What is the difference between the spread and rest operator?</h3>
        <p>The spread operator (...) expands an array or object, while the rest operator (...) collects multiple elements into an array or parameters and is used as a function parameter.</p>

    <div>
        <h3>7. In a for-in loop, why is the output undefined when accessing an object property using the dot operator?</h3>
        <p>The output is undefined because obj.key looks for a property literally named "key" in the object instead of dynamically accessing the property using the key variable.</p>
    </div>

    <div>
        <h3>8. Why should components start with a capital letter?</h3>
        <p>Components should start with a capital letter because React uses capitalized names to differentiate components from standard HTML tags.</p>
